🛒 Amazon eCommerce project overview
This project involves working with a simulated Amazon-style eCommerce database, designed to reflect the core operations of an online marketplace. The database includes customers, products, orders, order items, and reviews — enabling real-world business analysis using SQL.

The goal is to perform various SQL queries on the dataset to extract insights, identify trends, and support data-driven decisions.

Understand and model relationships between different business entities (customers, orders, products, etc.)

Write SQL queries for filtering, aggregating, joining, and subquerying data.

Perform customer and product-level analytics.

Discover patterns in purchasing behavior, product popularity, and user engagement.

Simulate tasks typical for data analysts in an eCommerce company.
